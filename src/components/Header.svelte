		An interactive visualisation that provides access to a selection of objects from the
		'Lipperheidesche Kost√ºmbibliothek'. <br />
		<span>{essays}</span> essays are juxtaposed with a graph navigation that allows the user to browse the paintings,
		prints, drawings and clothes in the collection. Instead of showing the collection in its entirety,
		it is accessible through a curated selection of essays designed to provide a better understanding
		of it. The aim is to combine editorial approaches with free navigation of the collection.
