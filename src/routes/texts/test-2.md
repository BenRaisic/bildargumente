### Fashionable attributes in the sibling portrait
The [males](media/1628) in the depiction are dressed in a wide-flared, sleeveless leather collar. The breeches are worn wide and are decorated with gold-coloured elements on the side trouser leg. The wide-legged cup or gauntlet boots fall in soft creases, and spurs are attached to the bootstrap. The toes of the boots are angularly shaped. The ensemble is completed by the decorative accessories of braudiers and buckles. The hair falls open and curly over a turn-down collar made of lace. The headgear consists of a felt or woollen hat (beaver fur?) with a high stiff headpiece and a narrow brim. Around the hat is a gold-coloured corded string. They hold their headdresses in their hands, which they rest on their hips. 
The three ladies depicted wear floor-length dresses of richly and fully embroidered textile, moderately puffed by petticoats. The club-shaped sleeves consist of a half-length sleeve and a long sleeve and fall stiffly. The waists are pushed upwards and the snip toes are moderately low. The décolletés are framed by flat, wide lace collars. The sitter's hair is tied in a knot, also called a chignon, above the ears and covered by a small bonnet. This hairstyle is accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls.

The present painting falls into the transitional period between the early Baroque, also marked by the time of the 30 Years War (1614-1648), and the High Baroque. Whereas during the Renaissance fashions still varied greatly from region to region, from 1630 onwards an increasingly large part of Europe was covered by a uniform style of hairstyle and dress. The Thirty Years' War separated the two great courtly fashions, the stiff Spanish fashion from the playful French fashion of the late Baroque under the fashion supremacy of King Louis XIV.

During the 30 Years' War, men's fashion is strongly influenced by military clothing, which in turn was composed of the elements of peasant costume and had been adapted to the needs of the wearer. The basic elements consisted of a felt hat, a soft overskirt, the leather collar over the doublet, the bandelier, a leather strap laid over the shoulder that held the rapier or sword, as well as comfortable breeches and cup boots, also called gauntlet boots. The man's decorative accessories were the hat, lace-trimmed sleeve cuffs, the lace collar and the adornment of the cup boots with lace, as well as the braudier, metal fasteners and buckles and spurs.

At the courts of France and England at the time of the Thirty Years' War, the ideal of the cavalier emerged in the so-called cavalier fashion, which was supposed to be characterised above all by courtly and gallant behaviour. The appearance is characterised by about calf-length, moderately wide-cut tube trousers, which replaced the tight-fitting leg warmers. The breeches were either tied or worn straight, at knee height and at the outer seams the textile was often decorated with metal threads or with nestels, later, at the time of the Rhine count's dress, with ribbon jewellery or rosettes. The legwear was supplemented by wide cup boots, which were sometimes filled out with lace. The front cap was no longer round but angular. 
The leather collar as a military garment had also found its way into the civilian context, its lap parts overlapping and taking up the wearer's movements as he stepped out.  The broad-brimmed hat worn with it, often adorned with an ostrich feather, and the wide cup boots reinforced the wearer's striding out by swinging the textiles. This was acoustically underpinned by the metal accessories such as baudrier and spurs, which had also found their way into the civilian context. Curly hair and a cavalier's beard were further hallmarks of the cavalier.
The attributes of cavalier dress were not only adopted, especially by the fashionable bourgeois, but were carried on to fashionable foppery. It was in this context that the term "monsieur à la mode" or "à la mode cavalier" was first used in Germany and France.

In women's clothing, the hoop skirt has been replaced and the now less extreme widening of the hips is achieved by hip pads and by puffy petticoats. The wide, pleated skirt is usually overlong and gathered as one walks. In the front, a deep, stiffened snood descends into the lap. By bending slightly forward, it accentuated the midriff and the high waistline. 
The sleeves were puffy wide to club-shaped and puffed. After 1640, the sleeves became ¾ length and slightly tighter. The stiffened Spanish ruff was now replaced by a soft, rounded shoulder and a rounded neckline collar falling over the shoulder. The trend towards a softly falling collar can be observed in women's fashion just as in men's fashion around 1630.

In women's fashion, a simple hairstyle replaced the high Spanish women's wigs around 1620. The hair is now tightly tied from the forehead and over the ears with the hair at the nape of the neck to form a strong chignon, an elaborate interweaving in the form of a pinned-up knot. The twisted braids, sometimes supported by netting, sit high on the back of the head and are framed by strings of pearls. This hairstyle is very often accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls. Later, around 1640, more freedom was given to fringe and side curls; especially in women's fashion, this harmonised with the soft drape of the dresses. In contrast to the bourgeois women, whose hairstyle required a bonnet, aristocratic ladies were allowed to display their artfully drawn curls openly.
