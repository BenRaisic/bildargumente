### Fashionable attributes in the sibling portrait

The [males](media/1628) in the depiction are dressed in a wide-flared, sleeveless leather collar. The breeches are worn wide and are decorated with gold-coloured elements on the side trouser leg. The wide-legged cup or gauntlet boots fall in soft creases, and spurs are attached to the bootstrap. The toes of the boots are angularly shaped. The ensemble is completed by the decorative accessories of braudiers and buckles. The hair falls open and curly over a turn-down collar made of lace. The headgear consists of a felt or woollen hat (beaver fur?) with a high stiff headpiece and a narrow brim. Around the hat is a gold-coloured corded string. They hold their headdresses in their hands, which they rest on their hips. 
The three ladies depicted wear floor-length dresses of richly and fully embroidered textile, moderately puffed by petticoats. The club-shaped sleeves consist of a half-length sleeve and a long sleeve and fall stiffly. The waists are pushed upwards and the snip toes are moderately low. The décolletés are framed by flat, wide lace collars. The sitter's hair is tied in a knot, also called a chignon, above the ears and covered by a small bonnet. This hairstyle is accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls.

This is an [item](item/463), this is a [media](media/1602) and this is an [item set](set/31735).
