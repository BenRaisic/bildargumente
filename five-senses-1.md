description: "Combining the allegory of the Five Senses with genre scenes and also with family portraits finds its precursors in Dutch painting. For example, the portrait of the siblings of Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg was painted at another German court as early as 1637. The children are depicted in an interior room, the open window affording a view of the Braunschweig Burgplatz with the Braunschweig Lion and the so-called Mosthaus. In contrast to the Hohenlohe painting, the iconography of the allegorical representation is more complex. While there one attribute is attached to each figure, here several senses are assigned to the eldest, Rudolf August."

Combining the allegory of the [Five Senses](item/10614) with genre scenes and also with family portraits finds its precursors in Dutch painting. For example, the [portrait of the siblings of Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg](item/43003) was painted at another German court as early as 1637. The children are depicted in an interior room, the open window affording a view of the Braunschweig Burgplatz with the Braunschweig Lion and the so-called “Mosthaus”.

### Portrait of siblings
The painting [“The Five Senses”](item/159) from the Modebild Collection shows the five children of  [“Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg”](item/9499).
From left to right can be seen: [“Eva Christina”](item/9390) as [“auditus”](item/10613) (hearing) with a lute, 
[Anna Magdalena](item/9428), as  [visus](item/10536) (seeing) with a [mirror](item/10946), as [tactus](item/10586) (feeling) with a bird pecking into the hand, [Joachim Albrecht] as [Gustus](item/10913) (tasting) with an apple and [Heinrich Friedrich] as Odoratus (smelling) with a flower. Thus this is a portrait of a sibling combined with an allegory of the five senses. This is unique in the oeuvre of the painter [Joachim Georg Creuzfelder](item/9350). In this portrait of siblings, the young Hohenlohe court painter combines the common iconographic sign inventory of the allegory of the Five Senses with a family portrait. Creuzfelder chose a simple assignment of five sense attributes to one portrait each, in which no biographically based assignment pattern can be read.

Like other cycles - for example the "Four Continents" or the Deadly Sins - the "Five Senses" became a popular allegorical subject in the 16th century, spreading mainly through Dutch prints. The Five Senses cycle by Cornelis Cort after designs by Frans Floris (1561) led the way. 
In it, he combines two concepts that were already widespread in the Middle Ages: Female personifications of the senses endowed with attributes (significant objects) are accompanied by symbolising animals endowed with senses.
Such picture cycles or individual scenes, in which one sense is singled out and interpreted as a symbol, were particularly popular (example: Tactus). Since the end of the 16th century, however, there have also been allegorical representations of the five senses. After 1587, Adam van Noort created the [drawings](item/42994) for two engravings in which the Five Senses are united on one sheet. In the engraving realised by Adriane Collaert, a new realistic conception of the theme can be seen, with which the change from the original allegorical image to a bourgeois social image begins.
Genre depictions and family portraits combined with the theme of the Five Senses were also initially disseminated mainly in the Netherlands. The painting "The Five Senses" from the Modebild collection is an example of this.
